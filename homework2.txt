1. 
Odd squares can only be formed by odd numbers as even numbers will form even squares.

Lets take any odd number x.

x — ? (mod 8) Then ? can be 1, 3, 5, 7

Because x = 8k + ? and removing something even from an odd number will leave back an odd number.

? = x - 8k

So we only need to check modulus of the squares of 1,3,5,7

1*1 — 3*3 — 5*5 — 7*7 — 1 (mod 8) so statement is true.

Even squares:

2*2 — 4 (mod 8)

4*4 — 0 (mod 8)

6*6 — 4 (mod 8)

8*8 — 0 (mod 8) and so on.

2. Tried vanity address generator.

3. (i) The time is takes to solve a problem increases proportionally to the size of the input.

(ii)  The time is takes to solve a problem is independent to the size of the input.

(iii)  The time is takes to solve a problem increases log n times (very slowly) as the size of the input n increases.

For a proof, it should be O(1) as the proof should be independent of the size of the input.
